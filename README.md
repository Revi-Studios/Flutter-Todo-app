- Clone the latest repository and build it your self. Se [Building Guide](#building-the-app-your-self) for help


## How do I build the application myself?
To download and be able to build the application, make sure you have these things installed:
```
- Flutter (SDK)
- Github CLI
```

Once you have those installed and setup follow these intructions:
1. Clone the repository using you terminal:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Revi-Studios/Flutter-Todo-app.git
```
2. Navigate to the repository and run `flutter run`:
```
$Â cd /REPOSITORY
$ flutter run
```
This should build the files you need and then try to run the app on a connected android emulator or a fysical device if setup.
